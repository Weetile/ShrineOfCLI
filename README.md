# ShrineOfCLI

This Python script retrieves and formats information from [DBD Playerstats](https://dbd.tricky.lol).

It displays the current perks available in the Shrine and their details, including name and description.

The information is presented in a formatted table using the Python Rich library, with stylized text based on the role (survivor or killer) of each perk.

## Usage

```bash
pip3 install rich # On Arch Linux, this would instead be 'sudo pacman -Sy python-rich'
git clone https://github.com/Weetile/ShrineOfCLI.git # Clone the repository
cd ShrineOfCLI # Enter the directory
python3 main.py # Run the script
```
